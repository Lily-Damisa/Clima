# Clima Weather Application

Clima is a weather application that provides detailed weather information for a location specified by the user. It shows the latest weather data. 

# Built With
1. React.js
2. Open Weather API

I used the fetch method to fetch the API calls along with the React hooks and conditional rendering.
